# vehicle recognition suite
3 different aproaches to vehicle detection, counting and classification using computer vision

In this repository we test the out-of-the-box performance of the Single shot multibox detector (SDD) by google, the mask-RCNN algorithm and a custom segmentation + classification algorithm, all in python.

Each folder contains a project.
